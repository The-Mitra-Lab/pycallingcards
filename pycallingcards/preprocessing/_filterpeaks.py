    """\

    Filter peaks based on number of cells or counts.
    Keep peaks that have at least `min_counts` counts or are expressed in at
    least `min_cells` cells or have at most `max_counts` counts or are expressed
    in at most `max_cells` cells.
    Only provide one of the optional parameters `min_counts`, `min_cells`,
    `max_counts`, `max_cells` per call.


    :param data:
        An annotated data matrix of shape `n_obs` * `n_vars`. Rows correspond
        to cells and columns to peaks.
    :param min_counts:
        Minimum number of counts required for a peak to pass filtering.
    :param min_cells:
        Minimum number of cells expressed required for a peak to pass filtering.
    :param max_counts:
        Maximum number of counts required for a peak to pass filtering.
    :param max_cells:
        Maximum number of cells expressed required for a peak to pass filtering.
    :param inplace:
        Perform computation inplace or return result.
        
    :Returns:
    
    Depending on `inplace`, returns the following arrays or directly subsets
    and annotates the data matrix.

    | **peak_subset** - Boolean index mask that does filtering. `True` means that the
        peak is kept. `False` means the peak is removed.
    | **number_per_peak** - Depending on what was tresholded (`counts` or `cells`), the array stores
        `n_counts` or `n_cells` per peak.   
        
    :Example:
    >>> import pycallingcards as cc
    >>> adata_ccf = cc.datasets.mousecortex_data(data="CCF")
    >>> cc.pp.filter_peaks(adata_ccf, min_counts=1)
